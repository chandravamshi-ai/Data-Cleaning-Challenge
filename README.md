# Data-Cleaning-Challenge
This is a Kaggle data cleaning challenge by Rachel, where she explains about various data cleaning process which are used while doing data preprocessing while fitting a model. This is a five day challenge.
This challenge in kaggle very useful for begineers, it is like a mini course.

There is a saying if I give you 1hour to do a job spend 50 minutes in prepartion and 10 minutes in executing. The same applies in machine learning. We need to spend good amount of time in analysing and processing the data to fit a model.
